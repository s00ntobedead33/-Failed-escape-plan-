# -Quick assumptions-
Just a russian-korean manga creator and an infamous artist 
"If you are to fight someone, always stab on the knee, not the stomach because weakness is not always the solution for victory, first, you should weaken the muscles, not the life, killing the victim easily means you are just a coward looking forward to end the life quickly instead of feeling the suffer, because there's a chain that connects the leg with the hand, which means all the strength goes down since the hand won't be needed in such situations and leg is all the way."
